Types of Data
We first learned that data can be categorized into three main types:
•	Structured Data – Data stored in a fixed format with rows and columns (e.g., tables in SQL)
•	Semi-Structured Data – Data with some structure but not strictly tabular (e.g., JSON, XML)
•	Unstructured Data – Data with no predefined format (e.g., images, videos, text files)
Based on these data types, we discussed how different databases are designed.
Relational vs Non-Relational Databases
•	Relational Databases store structured data in tables and use SQL (e.g., MySQL)
•	Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases handle semi-structured or unstructured data
We also learned that databases are stored on servers, not on our local system directly.
DBMS and SQL
•	A DBMS (Database Management System) is used to connect to and manage database servers.
•	SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language used to communicate with databases.
We understood the logical flow of how data is organized:
Workbench → Server → Database → Schema → Tables → Columns & Rows
SQL Command Categories
We learned that SQL commands are grouped into different categories based on their purpose:
Category	Purpose
DDL (Data Definition Language)	Defines database structure
DML (Data Manipulation Language)	Inserts, updates, deletes data
DQL (Data Query Language)	Retrieves data
DCL (Data Control Language)	Controls permissions
TCL (Transaction Control Language)	Manages transactions

DDL Commands (Structure Creation & Modification)
We practiced DDL commands to create and modify databases and tables.
Creating a Database
CREATE DATABASE company_db;
Creating a Table
CREATE TABLE company_db.test_table  (id INT, name VARCHAR(100));
Viewing Data (DQL)
SELECT * FROM company_db.test_table;
Inserting Data (DML)
We inserted records into the table using:
INSERT INTO company_db.test_table (id, name)
VALUES
(1, 'alice'),
(2, 'welborn'),
(3, 'heop');
Altering Tables
We learned how to modify existing tables:
•	Adding a new column
•	Renaming a column
ALTER TABLE company_db.test_table
ADD email VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE company_db.test_table
RENAME COLUMN email TO email_id;
Dropping Tables
We discussed how to safely delete tables:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS company_db.persons;

Primary Key and Foreign Key Concepts
We learned that:
•	A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table
•	A Foreign Key creates a relationship between two tables
Important Clarification (Doubt Resolved)
•	Foreign keys can only be implemented at the table level
•	A primary key from another database cannot be referenced
•	Foreign key relationships must exist within the same database
Foreign Key Constraints
We discussed special keywords used with foreign keys:
RESTRICT
•	Prevents deleting a parent record if it is referenced in a child table
CASCADE
•	Automatically updates or deletes related records in child tables
•	Example: Updating a phone number everywhere it is referenced
Other Important Constraints
•	DEFAULT – Assigns a default value if no value is provided
•	CHECK – Ensures data follows a condition
Example:
Age INT CHECK (Age > 18)
DROP vs DELETE vs TRUNCATE
We clearly understood the difference:
•	DROP – Deletes the entire table (structure + data)
•	DELETE – Deletes specific rows using a WHERE condition
•	TRUNCATE – Deletes all rows quickly but keeps the table structure
Our homework is to practice Create, Read, and Update (CRUD) operations on our local MySQL database server.
We were specifically instructed not to modify any tables in the Sakila database.
